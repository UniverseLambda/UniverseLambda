### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm ClÃ©ment SAAD, *(aka UniverseLambda)*.**

I'm a developper actually studying in [42lyon](https://42lyon.fr/) (a school from the [42 Network](https://42.fr/)) though it was already my job before.

Enjoy *(or suffer)* visiting my repos and admire *(or vomit in front of)* my code ðŸ˜‰

### Repos 
#### 42's projects

Removed my projects for now.

#### Personnal projects
- uLambda's Compiler Library, a library aiming to help creating compiler (yes, in Java): [ulambda-compiler-lib-java](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ulambda-compiler-lib-java)
- uLambda's Debug Library, a library aiming to help debug containers coded in C++98: [ulambda-debug-library](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ulambda-debug-library)
- Katnoisi LLVM, a contextual language compiler developped in Rust (it's an almost empty project, currently only a lexer-wannabe): [ktns-llvm](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ktns-llvm)

**A lot of my personnal projects are still private. I'll set them to public in the near future**

Btw, I'll create a site in the near future.
