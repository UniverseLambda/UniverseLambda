### Hi there üëã

**I'm Cl√©ment SAAD, *(aka UniverseLambda)*.**

I'm a developper actually studying in [42lyon](https://42lyon.fr/) (a school from the [42 Network](https://42.fr/)) though it was already my job before.

Enjoy *(or suffer)* visiting my repos and admire *(or vomit in front of)* my code üòâ

### Repos 
#### 42's projects

A fair warning before exploring my school projects: those done in C follow a strict formatting norm imposed by the school, so it doesn't actually represent my way of coding/formatting my code. I apologize in advance for that.

- ft_transcendence, an online pong using NodeJS, TypeScript, NestJS and Angular: [42-ft_transcendence-backend (backend)](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-ft_transcendence-backend)/[Training-trancendance (main repo, on another student profile)](https://github.com/sach1095/Training-trancendance)
- ft_irc, a partial implementation of a IRC server in C++98: [42-ft_irc](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-ft_irc)

- ft_containers, a reimplementation of some of C++'s containers (Vector, Map, Stack) and more in C++98: [42-ft_containers](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-ft_containers)
- C++ pool, some small projects aiming to introduce students to C++98: [42-cpp-00](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-00), [42-cpp-01](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-01), [42-cpp-02](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-02), [42-cpp-03](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-03), [42-cpp-04](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-04), [42-cpp-05](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-05), [42-cpp-06](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-06), [42-cpp-07](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-07), [42-cpp-08](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-cpp-08)
- philosopher, an introduction to POSIX multi-threading in C98: [42-philosopher](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-philosopher)
- push_swap, a stack ordering program with a limit set of instruction in C: [42-push_swap](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-push_swap)
- minitalk, a client-server project based on POSIX signal (that's not a joke): [42-minitalk](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-minitalk)
- libasm, some C methods reimplemented in assembly (x86_64, Intel Syntax, SysV ABI, never evaluated): [42-libasm](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-libasm)
- ft_printf, a partial implementation of printf in C: [42-ft_printf](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-ft_printf)
- get_next_line, a project with a function to read a file descriptor line by line... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [42-get_next_line](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-get_next_line)
- libft, a partial reimplementation of the libc functions (with some additions, also may have been modified to go further and may part with the subject): [42-libft](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/42-libft)

Some 42 projects may be missing due to various reasons, they may be made public in the future.

#### Personnal projects
- uLambda's Compiler Library, a library aiming to help creating compiler (yes, in Java): [ulambda-compiler-lib-java](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ulambda-compiler-lib-java)
- uLambda's Debug Library, a library aiming to help debug containers coded in C++98: [ulambda-debug-library](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ulambda-debug-library)
- Katnoisi LLVM, a contextual language compiler developped in Rust (it's an almost empty project, currently only a lexer-wannabe): [ktns-llvm](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ktns-llvm)

**A lot of my personnal projects are still private. I'll set them to public in the near future**

Btw, I'll create a site in the near future.
