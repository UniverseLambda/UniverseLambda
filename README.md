## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### **I'm ClÃ©ment SAAD, *(aka UniverseLambda)*.**

I'm a developper, currently employed at DIMO Software (until I manage to give my manager a mental breakdown).

Self learning since very young and (*kinda successfuly*) studied at [42lyon](https://42lyon.fr), Rust enthusiast ðŸ¦€.

I don't bite (most of the time at least). So hmu if you want to talk, I just take a lot of time to answer.

### Repos 

#### Personnal projects
- Eclair Game Engine, my rewrite of the Blitz3D game engine with an LLVM backend: [eclair-ge](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/eclair-ge)
- uLambda's Easy Scripting Language, my : [ulesl](https://github.com/UniverseLambda/ulesl)

**A lot of my personnal projects are still private. I'll set them to public in the near future**

#### School projects

They are private right now, and that might be definitive.
